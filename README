posixovl provides a filesystem view that supports various POSIX operations while
using an otherwise incapable lower filesystem. Filesystems of various degrees of
POSIXness can be utilitzed. VFAT is a common denominator when it comes to
cross-compatibility, though NTFS its features are unused in Linux would be
another possibility. Secondly, potent native POSIX-style filesystems can also be
used, though the actual use of doing that remains to be discovered.
